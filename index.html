                    <!-- Bio -->

                    <p>Melissa was born and raised in the Philadelphia suburbs. She attended the University of Chicago and graduated with a degree in Philosophy. She took enough math courses that the United States government considers her to have a minor in Mathematics, but the University of Chicago does not. </p>

                    <p>After college she moved to Yeongwol, South Korea, where she taught English as a Foreign Language. In 2009 she joined the Peace Corps, and was sent to Tanzania, in East Africa, to teach secondary school mathematics. After returning to America, she spent a few years working in office/administrative jobs, before she began teaching gymnastics. Most recently, Melissa taught gymnastics and dance at the YMCA, where she had students as young as 12 months all the way up to 12 years old-- not all in the same class, thankfully! </p>

                    <p>Most of Melissa's social and personal life revolves around political activist/advocacy groups and events, and she is passionate about harm reduction. She believes that everyone should carry Narcan, which is available at any pharmacy to any Pennsylvania resident and depending on your insurance is probably between $0-$5-- but if you run into any problems, you can also ask her for a dose to carry! Melissa also enjoys attending the Fringes and Tikkun Olam Havurahs in Northwest Philly, writing, and spending time with her dog Ivy. </p>
